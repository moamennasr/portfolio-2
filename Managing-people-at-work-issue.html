                                   <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>Workplace management is about the resolution of a number of issues like communication, handling conflict, motivation of employees, performance management, team building, work-life balance, diversity and inclusion, change management, leadership development, and legal and ethical compliance. The effective management needs the tools to encourage the open communication, collaboration, and employee engagement to further the development of a healthy work environment that will support both individual and organizational success. Banfield, P., Kay, R., & Royles, D. (2018).</p>
									<h2>Managing people at work issues</h2>
									<p>Leading people at work could be a very complex task, and the requirement may be reticent to be navigated with an amalgamation of leadership, empathy, and strategic thinking. For someone who is a manager of a big department or a small team, managing the intricate relationships between colleagues is a big part of management. We also have to focus on identifying the unique traits of each team member and encourage a supportive environment where all staff are motivated and committed, both individually and as a team. Cardon, M. S. (2004).</p>
									<h2>Work-based managing people issues to be analyzed at QNB International Bank</h2>
									<h3>Promoting diversity and inclusion</h3>
									<p>A bank's diversity and inclusion approach is a core factor in building a workplace that fosters a supportive and efficient work culture. However, several common issues may arise in the pursuit of D&I: Weiss, J. W. (2021).</p>
									<h4>1.  Representation:</h4>
									<p> Securing a diverse representation for all the levels in the organization even at the leadership position is the hardest thing. There can be some groups that may be underrepresented, hence, there may be the lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making processes. Bassett, J., Lloyd, C., & Bassett, H. (2001).</p>
									<h4>2.  Unconscious Bias:</h4> With all the effort to develop a diverse workforce, there is still a chance for the unconscious bias to affect the hiring, promoting, and performance evaluation processes. Such causes raise questions of fairness and equal treatment of employees from different backgrounds. Kilpatrick, D. (1959)
									<h4>3.  Inclusive Leadership:</h4> Leaders may find themselves in a spot where they do not know how to create an inclusive environment, where all the employees feel appreciated and respected. Lack of information or knowledge about cross-cultural realities and backgrounds can be a barrier to the development of an inclusive community. Kolb, D.(1984)
									<h2>From QNB sustainability performance summary</h2>
									<h4>Board seats occupied by men (%) and Board seats occupied by women (%):</h4> These metrics show the gender diversity within the board of directors.

									<p>Studies by Catalyst ("Why Diversity and Inclusion Matter: The pairs'( "Women on Boards" and "Delivering through Diversity") and McKinsey ("Diversity on the Board") treat about the positive side of business boards'multicultural character in the decision-making process and the creation of innovation. The regular shortage of the female sort of people in the Board of seats suggests the possible existence of the challenges in terms of the incorporation of the inclusive and representative culture of society, which does not give the ground for long-term success of the organization. Mabey, C.  (1998)</p>

									<p>The graph below represents Board seats occupied by men & women at QNB International Bank.</p>

									<p>we can see that The consistent 0% for women indicates a lack of gender diversity, which may raise concerns about inclusivity and representation.</p>
									



									<p>Male employees consistently outnumber female employees across all years, with the gap narrowing slightly over time. In 2021, there were 11,392 male employees compared to 10,205 female employees, while in 2023, the numbers were 11,851 male employees and 10,960 female employees.</p>
									<p>The gender distribution raises questions about gender diversity and inclusivity within the organization.</p>
									


									<h5>From the graphs below for the year 2021 and the changes that occurred in 2022 and 2023</h5>
									<h5>Middle East:</h5>
									In 2021: 2,536 employees
									In 2022: 2,566 employees
									Change: +30 employees
									Percentage Change: +1. 18%
									Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): 4.01%

									<h5>Asia:</h5>
									In 2021: 603 employees
									In 2022: 508 employees
									Change: -95 employees
									Percentage Change: -15. 75%
									CAGR: +1. 38%

									<h5>Africa:</h5>
									In 2021: 7,353 employees
									In 2022: 7,601 employees
									Change: +248 employees
									Percentage Change: +3. 37%
									CAGR: +1. 36%

									<h5>Europe:</h5>
									In 2021: 11,105 employees
									In 2022: 11,594 employees
									Change: +489 employees
									Percentage Change: +4. 40%
									CAGR: +2. 84%

									<h2>Observations:</h2>
									<p>The workforce in the Middle East experienced a slight boost, it being captured by a low positive percentage change, and also a comparatively high compound annual growth rate.

									<br>The region of Asa had relatively lower number of employees as compared with other regions with a reflected negative percentage change, which could were attributed to lost employees.

									<br>Result of all actions, taken, was surprisingly stable increase in the number of employees in Africa, with positive in the percentage change and relative low compound annual growth rate.

									<br>The number of employees in Europe, that is to say, the positive percentage change and the CAGR (compound annual growth rate), that was higher comparing to others countries as well, was significant on the upside.

									<br>Consequently, Europe witnessed the largest amount of development in employment numbers, and the Asian labour force decreased in appurtenance. The Middle East and Africa equally, in a similar kind of manner, the workforce of these two regions were only moderately increased. Conclusion:
									 the big difference in the workforce in each regain might indicate less focus on diversity from 	QNB side.
									


									<br>Both total employee turnover and voluntary employee turnover increased significantly from 2021 to 2022, indicating a higher rate of employees leaving the company during this period.
									<br>The percentage increase in turnover is higher for voluntary turnover compared to total turnover, suggesting that employees are leaving the company more voluntarily rather than involuntarily.
									<br>The increase in turnover rates could be attributed to various factors, including changes in company policies, market conditions, job satisfaction, or external factors like economic changes or industry trends.

									<h5>1.	Group BOD members under 30 years old (%), Group BOD members between 30-50 years old (%), Group BOD members over 50 years old (%):</h5> <p>These metrics provide insight into the age distribution of the board members.</p>
									<p>The stable percentages across the years suggest a consistent age demographic within the board.</p>
									<p>We can clearly see from the graph below that from the year 2021 to the year 2023 most of the BOD members are 50 years old or higher with a small percentage of them from 30 to 50 years old and none of them under the age of 30 which might indicate a lack of acknowledgment for younger talents.</p>
									
										<h2>Solutions & recommendations based on academic resources & case studies.</h2>
									<h4>1.  Implement Gender-Inclusive Policies and Practices:</h4>
									<p>- Research conducted in academic settings (e. g. , World Economic Forum's "Global Gender Gap Report") stresses the need of implementing gender-inclusive policies and practices as a way of eradicating systemic restrictions and promoting gender equality in the work environment. Companies can set up rules like equal pay for equivalent work, flexible work arrangement, paid leaves and childcare support to create an environment where women can work with ease. Bratton, J. and Gold, J. (2022)</p>
									<p>- The examples of Microsoft, IBM and Deloitte companies which were able to bridge the gender gap using the measures that included policies for work-life balance, mentorship programs and women leadership development programs are the evident cases of success. Pettigrew, A. and Whipp, R. (1991)</p>
									<h4>2.  Promote Gender Diversity in Leadership Positions:</h4>
<p>- According to the research released by McKinsey ("Women in the Workplace") gender diversity in leadership is not only a good business practice but also the case of financial success and innovation. Organizations need to focus on increasing the number of women in leadership by employing targeted recruitment, mentoring programs, leadership development initiatives, and appointment processes that are transparent. Corrall, S. (2000).</p>
<p>- The examples of Unilever, Accenture and Google among others as companies that have successfully implemented strategies for promoting gender diversity in leadership, such as setting diversity targets, implementing bias training and providing sponsorship programs for women leaders are illustrative ones.</p>

<h4>3.  Foster Inclusive Organizational Cultures:</h4>
<p>- Academic literature, including studies by Cox and Blake ("Managing Cultural Diversity: The (Implications of Diversity for Organizational Competitiveness”) article underlines the significance of establishing environments that are inclusive within organizations where all employees are valued and respected. Companies can improve diversity and inclusion through actions like the creation of employee resource groups, cultural competency training, and diversity awareness campaigns.</p>
<p>- The case studies of the companies, such as Salesforce, Airbnb, and Johnson & Johnson, show that organizations with inclusive cultures have positive impact on employee engagement, retention, and performance.  The leadership commitment accountability is pointed out as the important factors that are driving cultural change within organizations. Anderson, D., & Ackerman Anderson, L. (2010).</p>

<h4>4.  Address Unconscious Bias and Stereotypes:</h4>
<p>- Research done by Harvard University's Project Implicit and the Center for Talent Innovation confirms just how prevalent the unconscious bias and stereotypes are in the workplace.  Those can potentially hinder women's career advancement and the gap between men and women becomes wider. Organizations should allocate money in training programs and awareness campaigns that will educate employees about the unconscious bias, fight with stereotypes, and promote inclusive behaviors.</p>
<p>- As the case of Starbucks, Facebook and Airbnb has shown, the companies have implemented actions such as unconscious bias training, diversity-centered recruitment policies and diversity-focused performance reviews. Fombrun, C. et al (1984)</p>


<h2>Outline implementation strategy for the solutions</h2>

<p>The solutions for closing the gender gap and promoting diversity at workplaces call for a holistic plan to be implemented with a focus on the organizational culture, policies, practices, and leadership commitment. Here's an outline of the implementation strategy</p>

<h4>1.  Assessment and Benchmarking:</h4>
<p>- Carry out an assessment of the current condition of diversity and inclusion within the organization and define the gender representation, leadership demographics, pay disparity, and employees satisfaction.</p>
<p>- Compare with your industry competitors, best practices and diversity indices to select the areas of improvement and set goals for advancement. Armstrong, M. (2009)</p>

<h4>2.  Leadership Commitment and Communication:</h4>
<p>- Get a buy-in and a commitment from senior leadership to take diversity and inclusion as an important strategic objective.</p>
<p>- A communication plan should be developed and used to proclaim the business case for diversity, the organization's dedication to creating an open culture, and the leadership accountability aspect in effecting change. Belcourt, M., Singh, P., Snell, S., & Morris, S. (2022).

<h4>3.  Policy and Practice Review:</h4>
<p>- Analyze the existing policies and procedures with respect to hiring, promotions, pay equity, work-life balance, parental leave, and diversity training.</p>
<p>- Identify gaps and strengthen the policies or develop new ones to make them gender-neutral, unbiased and favorable to diversity and inclusion. heotokas, I., & Progoulaki, M. (2007).</p>

<h4>4.  Training and Education:</h4>
<p>- Design training programs that will make employees at all levels more aware of unconscious bias, diversity, inclusive leadership, and cultural competence.</p>
<p>- The employment of specialized training for hiring managers, recruiters, and decision-makers would help in mitigating bias in recruitment, promotion, and performance evaluation.

<h4>5.  Talent Management and Development:</h4>
<p>- Provide programs that allow to identify and develop high-potential women and the diverse talent from within the organization.</p>
<p>- Design mentorship and sponsorship programs that will guide women and underrepresented groups on career advancement and leadership development.</p>
<p>- Implement initiatives for skill-building, job placement, and networking to enrich the talent sourcing avenue of diverse individuals.</p>

<h4>6.  Promotion of Work-Life Balance:</h4>
<p>- Consider the implementation of flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, part-time, and job-sharing for employees to better address their personal needs and responsibilities.</p>
<p>- Develop the policies of parental leave, and childcare support to maintain the retention and advancement of women in the workforce. Heath, R. L., & Palenchar, M. J. (2008).</p>
